# E-Commerce using .NET Core MVC

## Introduction
Greetings,

I'm pleased to announce the completion of my E-Commerce project. This project is built using **ASP.NET Core MVC** with a **3-tier architecture**, incorporating various advanced programming concepts and patterns to ensure a robust, scalable, and efficient application.

## Key Features

- **Technologies and Patterns**: The application leverages the **Repository Pattern** (Generic repositories), **Unit of Work**, **asynchronous programming**, **Specification Pattern**, **AutoMapper**, **ASP.NET Identity** (for user and role management), **External Login**, **Stripe Payment Integration**, **Response Caching**, and **Sending Emails** functionality.

- **External Authentication**: Users can log in using their Google or Microsoft accounts, simplifying the authentication process.

- **Advanced Item Filtering**: The application allows for easy filtering of items based on categories, minimum to maximum price range, with sorted results. This is achieved using the Specification Pattern, enhancing user experience by eliminating the need for page reloads.

- **Shopping Cart Functionality**: Users can add or remove items from their cart without the need for a page reload, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.

- **Stripe Payment Integration**: Integrated Stripe for secure and hassle-free online payments.

- **Password Recovery**: A user-friendly password recovery feature that enables users to easily reset their passwords. The application facilitates this by sending a new password to the user's email.

- **Feedback System**: Users can send feedback to the admin, including their name, the subject, and the feedback details.

- **Role Seeding and Management**: The application automatically assigns roles (User or Admin) upon login. Admin users gain access to a dashboard icon in the navigation bar, which leads to the admin dashboard.

- **Admin Dashboard**: The dashboard provides CRUD operations for Products and Categories, and access to user feedback, enabling efficient management of the e-commerce platform.

- **Optimization**: The application is optimized for efficiency through asynchronous programming and response caching.

## Front End Technologies
The front-end is crafted using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with **JQuery** for dynamic updates of partial views without full page reloads, ensuring a smooth and responsive user interface.
